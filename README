Tinyruby
========

For a course in the University we have as a homework the task to implement 
a small subset of the Ruby language with support of the most typical features
of imperative languages plus some additionals features of OOP (like classes 
defintion and object creation but no inheritance, neither polimorfism).

Tinyruby borns there, a very small and not finished (yet) ruby interpreter. 

Probably FAQ
============

* If not finished and also fails in some cases, why you bother to upload it here?
  I've decided to upload it to github because I think there are lot's of people 
  that can or wants to create a interpreter and I think our code can be a good start.

* The code is ugly and you use don't know a piece of C, why you show us that?
  Probably you're right, the code is not so elegant and should have many errors.
  I know more C than my team mate, so difficult to get used in a few weeks. 
  I think the same reason above is valid here, I think and I believe show what you
  do is better than don't, it's just a matter of principles.

* Will this project continue or just will be another dead one?
  I really have a lot of fun doing it, but working full time and taking care of a 
  family give me very little time to play with. Anyway, I hope to add time to time
  a new feature, at least, fix all the bugs and improve what we reached.
